## Introduction

These are three different Web Components:
- `fh-stencil-button` is a simple button designed using Stencil JS.
- `fh-vanilla-comp-button` is the same button component, but built using simple vanilla JS.
- `web-comp-stencil` is a "drawer" component.

## Features

- These are all experimental and just built to explore the ideas of Web Components and StencilJS.
- The stencil projects have separate `README.md`s to explain that process.
